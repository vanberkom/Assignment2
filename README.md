# Assignment 2
### Device: Samsung S20
### Android Version: Android 13

This app is split up into 2 activities. MainActivity.kt and ChallengeActivity.kt, in the main activity 
I declared both of the intent actions, defined as onExplicitClick and onImplicitClick. Then in the MainScreen
function I listed my name and ID and then the two button. I used column type to lay them out so they weren't all
on top of each other.

For the ChallengeActivity.kt class, I defined the action for onBackClick whcihc will be called by the button. Then
in the function I created a list of the challenges I found off the internet and threw them into the same column type
split up by padding between each as I was printing each value in the list.
